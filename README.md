# mobbing

Mobbing is a tool that allows you to define who gets credit when pair
programming (_or mobbing_) when using git.

It was inspired by [Rogelio J. Samour's](http://blog.therubymug.com)
[hitch](https://github.com/therubymug/hitch) ruby gem (_and in fact it's pretty
much a clone of it with a teeny bit of more functionality_).

## Notes

- You will need to install [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) in order
  to run the unit tests.
- Currently this script does not run in fishshell
